What is a Docker Image?
Think of an image like a blueprint or template 
 It contains everything needed to run an application, such as:
                                                              The code or app itself
                                                              Dependencies (libraries, tools)
                                                              Configuration (environment setup)
                                                              Operating system layer

Example:

A PostgreSQL image = PostgreSQL software + Linux + config

A Python image = Python + libraries + basic OS

So you create a container from an image (like making copies of a design).

----------------------------------------------------------
1->docker run postgres

2->docker run -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password postgres
(It downloads and runs PostgreSQL (a database) in a Docker container.
So, instead of installing PostgreSQL manually on your PC, Docker sets it up inside a container — quickly and cleanly.)

Part	                                              Meaning
docker run	                                Tells Docker to create and start a new container
-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password	              This sets an environment variable inside the container 
                                            (in this case, it creates the PostgreSQL admin password = password)
postgres	                                  This is the image name you want to use (Docker will pull it from Docker Hub if not already downloaded)

3->docker run -d -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password postgres
-d means detached mode.
It tells Docker to run the container in the background — not on your screen.
It returns a unique ID that Docker gives to every container you run.

When you don’t use -d:
                       The container runs in your terminal
                       You see all the logs/output (it takes over your screen)
                       You can’t type new commands until you stop it

When you use -d:
                 The container starts quietly in the background
                 You get back control of your terminal immediately 
                 You can still check it later with:
                                                    docker ps
                                                 (to see running containers)

Bullseye = Codename for Debian 11,is a popular Linux distribution.
          Each version of Debian has a nickname (based on Toy Story movie characters ).
used in Docker image tags to tell which Linux base it’s built on.
