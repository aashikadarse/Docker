Restarting docker container
---------------------------

To restart a Docker container = stop it and start it again (like rebooting a small virtual machine).
Command:
docker restart <container_name_or_id>
Example:
docker restart vigilant_mestorf

This stops and starts that container again.
You can also stop and start separately:
docker stop <container_name_or_id>
docker start <container_name_or_id>

Example:
docker stop ubuntu_container
docker start ubuntu_container

To check its status after restarting:
docker ps -a

If it shows Up, it’s running
If it shows Exited, it stopped again (maybe because there’s nothing running inside it)
