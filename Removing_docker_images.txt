Removing Docker Images
--------------------
we can't delete by imageID 
we can delete by repository + Tag 

C:\Users\Exaze>docker images
REPOSITORY    TAG        IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
postgres      latest     41fc5342eefb   8 days ago     643MB
hello-world   latest     f7931603f70e   3 months ago   20.3kB
postgres      bullseye   724a6dfcc90f   5 months ago   605MB

C:\Users\Exaze>docker rmi hello-world:latest
Untagged: hello-world:latest
Deleted: sha256:f7931603f70e13dbd844253370742c4fc4202d290c80442b2e68706d8f33ce26

You can’t delete an image if any container (running or stopped) is still using it.
That’s because the container depends on the image’s data.

If you try, you’ll get an error like:
Error response from daemon: conflict: unable to remove repository reference "postgres" (must be forced) - container .

To Delete in Correct Order
---------------------------
->Stop the container (if it’s running):
  docker stop <container_name_or_id>

->Remove the container:
  docker rm <container_name_or_id>

->Now remove the image:
 docker rmi <image_name_or_id>
