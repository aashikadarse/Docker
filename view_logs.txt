View logs generated by the container
---------------------------------------
When a container runs, anything it prints to the terminal (stdout/stderr) — like messages, errors, or output — is stored by Docker as logs.

You can view them without entering the container.
Command to view logs
docker logs <container_id_or_name>
Example:
docker logs amazing_poincare

This will show all logs produced by your container.

Follow logs in real time
------------------------
If you want to see logs as they happen (live view) — like tail -f in Linux:
docker logs -f amazing_poincare

-f → follow mode (keeps showing new logs as they come)

You can stop viewing logs anytime by pressing:
Ctrl + C

Show only the latest logs
--------------------------
If the container has been running for a while, you can limit how much you see.
Show last 10 lines:
docker logs --tail 10 amazing_poincare

Show logs since 5 minutes ago:
docker logs --since 5m amazing_poincare

Combine options
----------------
You can combine them too!
For example:
docker logs -f --tail 20 amazing_poincare

This means:
“Show the last 20 lines, and keep following new logs as they appear.”
