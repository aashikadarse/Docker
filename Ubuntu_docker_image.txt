->docker run -d ubuntu:rolling
  Part	                                   Meaning
docker run	                        This tells Docker to create and start a new container.

-d	                                Means detached mode → runs the container in the background, not attached to your terminal.
                                    You’ll just see a container ID and can keep using your terminal.

ubuntu:rolling	                    This is the image name and tag.
                                    ubuntu = the base operating system image.
                                    rolling = the tag that refers to the latest rolling release version of Ubuntu (a continuously updated version).

If you open a terminal window and don’t type anything, it closes automatically.
Same here — Ubuntu started, saw no command to run, and said “Okay, I’m done!” → Exited (0)
