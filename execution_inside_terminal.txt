Execution of commands inside a running container
-------------------------------------------------
When you “run” a container, it’s like starting a mini-computer inside your system — it has its own terminal, files, and environment.
If that container is already running, you can execute (run) commands inside it just like you would on your own system.

Ways to execute commands inside a running container:
There are mainly two ways:
                          Option 1: Attach directly to its terminal
                                    If you want to interact with it like a normal shell (Linux prompt):
                                    docker exec -it <container_id_or_name> bash
                          Example:docker exec -it amazing_poincare bash

exec → means “execute a command inside the container”
-i → interactive mode (lets you type commands)
-t → allocates a terminal (gives you a nice prompt)
bash → the command you want to run (opens a shell)

Then you’ll see something like:
/#
Now you are inside the container, and you can run commands like:
                                                                pwd
                                                                ls
                                                                cat /etc/os-release

To exit, type:exit

Option 2: Run a single command without entering the shell
          You can run one command inside a running container directly from your host terminal.

Example:
docker exec amazing_poincare ls /data

This just runs the command and shows the output, without entering the shell.

Common Commands to Try Inside a Container
Command          	     Description
pwd	                   Shows current directory inside container
ls	                   Lists files
cat /etc/os-release	   Shows OS info
ps aux	               Shows running processes inside container
exit	                 Leaves the container shell
