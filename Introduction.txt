DOCKER:
------
Docker as  a solution for the containers management -it is an open source technology 
                                                     that allows us to manage containers 
                                                     in vert simple way.
Through Docker , we can create,deploy and run applications through the use of containers.
Means it provides a series of tools that allow us to manage the lifecycle of the container.
What does "Container" mean in Docker?

A container is basically a small, isolated box inside your computer that contains everything your application needs to run.
  ---------
Imagine this example:You made a Python app that needs:
                                                         Python 3.10
                                                         Flask library
                                                         Some files and environment settings
If you run it on someone else’s computer — it might fail because:They have Python 3.12
                                                                 Flask is not installed
                                                                 Different OS
                                                        Problem: Different setups break your app.

Solution (Container):
Docker puts your app + Python + Flask + settings into one container — like putting your project into a sealed box .
Now, that box will run the same way anywhere — on any computer, any server, any cloud.
In simple words:
A container is a lightweight, portable, isolated environment that runs your application along with everything it needs.


CI/CD pipeline:
What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for:
                CI → Continuous Integration
                CD → Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment

These are DevOps practices that help developers:
build code faster,
test automatically,
and deploy updates safely.

Continuous Integration (CI):
-----------------------
Continuous Integration means developers frequently add (integrate) their code into a shared repository (like GitHub).
Every time they add new code, it is:
                                   Automatically built (compiled),
                                   Automatically tested,
                                   Merge.
                                   If something breaks, they know immediately 

Example: Imagine 5 developers working on one project.
         Without CI:
                     Everyone codes separately for weeks.
                     When merging, everything crashes 
         With CI:
                 Everyone pushes small changes daily.
                 Docker or Jenkins automatically builds ,tests and merge code each time.
                 Errors are caught early .

Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment (CD):
------------------------------------------------
Once the app is tested (via CI), CD makes sure it can be automatically delivered or deployed to servers.

There are two types:
Type	                             Meaning
Continuous Delivery	             Automatic releaseto the repository
                                 
Continuous Deployment	           Automatic production deployment

Example:
       When you push code to GitHub, it automatically:
                                                      builds,
                                                      tests,
                                                      deploys to a live website!
CI/CD Together:They work like a pipeline:
--------------
Code → Build → Test → Deploy → Monitor

Simple Flow ->   Developer commits code to GitHub.
                               |
                               V
                 CI process builds and tests automatically.
                               |
                               V
                If tests pass → CD process deploys new version.
