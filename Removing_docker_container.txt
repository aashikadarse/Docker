How to manage and free up memory spcae ?
we can delete by names or by ID

Remove one container:
->docker rm <container_id_or_name>
  docker rm 004912bd2c42

->docker rm thirsty_wu zen_hoover

Remove active container forcefully - it turns offand deletes directly
->docker rm -f ID or name 

Remove all stopped containers:
->docker container prune
