Docker — Show System-Wide Information
-------------------------------------
Command:
docker info

The docker info command displays detailed system-wide information about your Docker installation, 
including server settings, containers, images, plugins, resources, and runtime environment.

It helps you understand how Docker is configured and currently operating on your system.

Operating System	                            The OS on which Docker Engine runs
CPUs / Memory	                                Hardware resources available to Docker
Docker Root Dir	                              Directory path where Docker stores container and image data




Docker — Viewing Container Statistics
-------------------------------------
Command:
docker stats

Explanation:
This command shows a real-time, live stream of performance metrics for all running containers — similar to top command in Linux.

 Displayed Columns:
Column	                   Description
CONTAINER ID	            Unique ID of the container
NAME	                    Name of the container
CPU %	                    Percentage of CPU the container is using
MEM USAGE / LIMIT	        Memory currently used vs. total limit
MEM %	                    Memory usage as a percentage of the total available
NET I/O	                  Amount of data transmitted and received over the network
BLOCK I/O	                Disk read/write usage by the container
PIDS	                    Number of processes or threads running in the container
Example Output:
CONTAINER ID   NAME         CPU %   MEM USAGE / LIMIT     MEM %   NET I/O           BLOCK I/O   PIDS
a1b2c3d4e5f6   redis_db     1.23%   50.4MiB / 1.94GiB     2.54%   1.2MB / 1.5MB     0B / 10MB   5
b2c3d4e5f6g7   postgres_db  0.87%   120.8MiB / 1.94GiB    6.20%   5.4MB / 4.7MB     2MB / 5MB   8
